# DebugRenderers

I initially made this mod to re-enable the 17 built-in debug renderers that are present in the Vanilla game's code but normally inaccessible.
Since then, it has grown into the platform which I do my Minecraft tinkering with, though its original functionality remains.

If you want to use this mod you will have to download and build it yourself. Keep in mind a few things:
* I recommend running this mod in a development environment or else many classnames in the UI will be obfuscated.
* I often push broken code to the repo, you may have to jump around the commit history a little to find a working version.
